### :man_technologist: About Me :
- 👀 Having gone through an introspective period trying to discover myself and where my passion lies, I realised I wanted to express myself through myself.
Whilst other people manifest themselves through poetry, music, or other art forms, I want to do it by creating tech, by transposing my ideas into reality. 
Creating is my medium.
- 🌱 I’m currently levelling up my Flutter skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Flutter side-projects.
